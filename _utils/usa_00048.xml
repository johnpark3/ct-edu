      <txt><![CDATA[DATANUM identifies the particular sample from which the case is drawn in a given year. For most censuses, the IPUMS has multiple datasets available which were constructed using different sampling techniques (i.e. size/demographic of the sample population, geographic coverage level or location, or duration of the sampling period for the ACS/PRCS samples).

The 1970 samples present a special case; in addition to geographic coding differences, the samples were drawn from two distinct questionnaires ("long forms"), referred to in the IPUMS as Form 1 and Form 2. Different questions were asked of the persons in the Form 1 and Form 2 samples, necessitating separate treatment in the record layout. For other census years, DATANUM has a value of 1 because only one sample is available for that year.

The availability table for each variable indicates whether that variable is available in only certain samples for a given year. For further discussion of sample differences, see "Sample Designs." [URL omitted from DDI.]]]></txt>

CBSERIAL is an 8-digit numeric variable which assigns a unique identification number to each household record in a given sample (See  CBPERNUM  for the analogous person record identifier). CBSERIAL specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below if applicable by Census year (and data sample if specified).

      <txt><![CDATA[HHWT indicates how many households in the U.S. population are represented by a given household in an IPUMS sample. 

It is generally a good idea to use HHWT when conducting a household-level analysis of any IPUMS sample. The use of HHWT is optional when analyzing one of the "flat" or unweighted IPUMS samples. Flat IPUMS samples include the 1% samples from 1850-1930, all samples from 1960, 1970, and 1980, the 1% unweighted samples from 1990 and 2000, the 10% 2010 sample, and any of the full count 100% census datasets. HHWT must be used to obtain nationally representative statistics for household-level analyses of any sample other than those.

Users should also be sure to select one person (e.g., PERNUM = 1) to represent the entire household.

For further explanation of the sample weights, see "Sample Designs" [URL omitted from DDI.] and "Sample Weights" [URL omitted from DDI.]. See also PERWT for a corresponding variable at the person level, and SLWT for a weight variable used with sample-line records in 1940 1% and 1950.]]></txt>
      <codInstr><![CDATA[
HHWT is a 6-digit numeric variable which indicates how many households in the U.S. population are represented by a given household in an IPUMS sample and has two implied decimals. For example, a HHWT value of 010461 should be interpreted as 104.61. HHWT specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below if applicable by Census year (and data sample if specified).

User Note: Users should also be sure to select one person (e.g., PERNUM = 1) to represent the entire household when using HHWT.

      <txt><![CDATA[HHTYPE is a constructed variable that mirrors the household type variable that the Census Bureau created in its 2000 PUMS sample (see page 6-37 of the 2000 PUMS codebook [URL omitted from DDI.]).  With HHTYPE, the IPUMS creates the variable consistently from 1940 onward.  A future version of this variable will provide the same categories for all IPUMS samples.

HHTYPE classifies all households as either family or nonfamily households.  Family households are distinguished from nonfamily households using RELATE.  A family household consists of a household head and one or more persons who are related to the household head by birth, marriage, or adoption and who are living together in the same household.  According to the household head's SEX and MARST, family households are classified as either a married-couple family or a family headed by a man/woman without a spouse present.  Family households with no spouse present include household heads of all marital statuses except married, spouse present (see MARST).  Households where an unmarried partner is present are classified as family households only if there are other persons in the household who are related to the household head by birth, marriage, or adoption.  Therefore, households containing only a household head and an unmarried partner are coded as nonfamily households.  Nonfamily households are distinguished by the sex of the household head and the presence of other unrelated individuals (including partners) living in the household.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[PUMA identifies the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) where the housing unit was located. In the 1990 State sample, PUMAs generally follow the boundaries of county groups, single counties, or census-defined "places". If these areas exceed 200,000 residents, they are divided into as many PUMAs of 100,000+ residents as possible. None of the 1990 State sample PUMAs cross state lines. For the 1990 Metro sample, PUMAs generally follow the boundaries of whole central cities, Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas, or non-metropolitan places (See METAREA for definitions of these terms). If these areas exceed 200,000 residents, they are divided into as many PUMAs of 100,000+ residents as possible. 1990 Metro sample PUMAs sometimes cross state lines; when they do, STATEFIP and STATEICP codes are not available for households in those PUMAs. PUMAs in the 2000 census, 2010 census, and the 2005-onward ACS/PRCS also consist of 100,000+ residents, and they do not cross state lines.

Note that PUMA is state-dependent. The codes must be read in combination with one of the STATE variables (STATEFIP or STATEICP). PUMAs are categorized by type (e.g., metropolitan, mixed metro/nonmetro, non-metropolitan) in the variable PUMATYPE. PUMA is similar to the county group variables, CNTYGP97 (1970) and CNTYGP98 (1980), and the State Economic Area variable (SEA) for 1940 and 1950.

Note Regarding Multi-Year Samples: The Census Bureau redraws PUMA boundaries every 10 years based on population information gathered from the most recent decennial census. ACS samples incorporate the new PUMAs within a few years of the Decennial Census. See the comparability statement to see which PUMAs are used in each sample. In Multi-Year ACS files, PUMA boundaries depend on the original year the respondent was interviewed (see MULTYEAR). For example in the 2010-2012 3-year ACS sample, respondents from 2010 and 2011 correspond to the Census 2000 based PUMAs, while respondents from 2012 correspond to the Census 2010 based PUMAs.]]></txt>
      <codInstr><![CDATA[
PUMA is a 5-digit numeric variable identifying the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) where the housing unit was located. PUMAs are categorized by type (e.g., metropolitan, mixed metro/nonmetro, non-metropolitan) in the variable PUMATYPE. PUMA is similar to the county group variables, CNTYGP97 (1970) and CNTYGP98 (1980), and the State Economic Area variable (SEA) for 1940 and 1950. PUMA specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below by Census year (and data sample if specified).

User Note: PUMAs are drawn and coded differently for the 1990 State and Metro samples. In the 1990 State sample, PUMAs generally follow the boundaries of groups of counties, single counties, or census-defined "places". If such areas exceed 200,000 residents, they are divided into as many PUMAs of 100,000+ residents as possible. None of the 1990 State sample PUMAs cross state lines. In the 1990 Metro sample, PUMAs generally follow the boundaries of whole central cities, Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas, or non-metropolitan places (See METAREA for definitions of these terms). If these areas exceed 200,000 residents, they are divided into as many PUMAs of 100,000+ residents as possible. 1990 Metro sample PUMAs sometimes cross state lines; when they do, STATEFIP and STATEICP codes are not available for households in those PUMAs. PUMAs in the 2000 census, 2010 census, and the 2005-onward ACS/PRCS also consist of 100,000+ residents, and they do not cross state lines.

User Note: PUMA is state-dependent, therefore the codes must be read in combination with one of the STATE variables: STATEFIP or STATEICP.

User Note: In the 2006-2011 ACS, persons living in Louisiana PUMAs 01801, 01802, and 01905 were all coded as living in Louisiana PUMA 77777. This is because these three PUMAs no longer had sufficient population to be included as separate entities due the effects of hurricane Katrina.]]></codInstr>

      <labl>Group quarters status</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[GQ classifies all housing units as falling into one of three main categories: households, group quarters, or vacant units. It also identifies fragmentary sample units for 1850-1930 (see below). In all years, the data available about a person and their co-residents depend on whether the person lives in a household or in group quarters. Households are sampled as units, meaning that everyone in the household is included in the sample, and most household-level variables are available. People living in group quarters are generally sampled as individuals; other people in their unit may or may not be included in the sample, and there is no way of linking co-residents' records to one another. If, however, a sampled person in group quarters was living with relatives, the related group was sampled for 1850-1930. Most household-level variables are not available for group quarters or for vacant units.

Group quarters are largely institutions and other group living arrangements, such as rooming houses and military barracks. The definitions vary from year to year, but the pre-1940 samples have generally used a definition of group quarters that includes units with 10 or more individuals unrelated to the householder. See the comparability discussion below and "Sample Designs" [URL omitted from DDI.] for more details about changing definitions of group quarters.  Group-quarters types are identified in further detail by GQTYPE and GQFUNDS.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[HHINCOME reports the total money income of all household members age 15+ during the previous year. The amount should equal the sum of all household members' individual incomes, as recorded in the person-record variable INCTOT. The persons included were those present in the household at the time of the census or survey. People who lived in the household during the previous year but who were no longer present at census time are not included, and members who did not live in the household during the previous year but who had joined the household by the time of the census or survey, are included. For the census, the reference period is the previous calendar year; for the ACS and the PRCS, it is the previous 12 months. 

Note that household income differs from family income, which is reported in FTOTINC. The family income variable only reports the incomes of household members related to the head, while HHINCOME includes the incomes of all household members. 

Amounts are expressed in contemporary dollars, and users studying change over time must adjust for inflation (See INCTOT for Consumer Price Index adjustment factors).  The exception is the ACS/PRCS multi-year files, where all dollar amounts have been standardized to dollars as valued in the final year of data included in the file (e.g., 2007 dollars for the 2005-2007 3-year file). Additionally, more detail may be available than exists in the original ACS samples.  

User Note: ACS respondents are surveyed throughout the year, and amounts do not reflect calendar year dollars. While the Census Bureau provides an adjustment factor (available in ADJUST), this is an imperfect solution. See the ACS income variables note [URL omitted from DDI.] for further details.]]></txt>

HHINCOME is a 7-digit numeric code which reports the total money income of all household members age 15+ during the previous year. The amount should equal the sum of all household members' individual incomes, as recorded in the person-record variable INCTOT. The persons included were those present in the household at the time of the census or survey. People who lived in the household during the previous year but who were no longer present at census time are not included, and members who did not live in the household during the previous year but who had joined the household by the time of the census or survey, are included.

Note that household income differs from family income, which is reported in FTOTINC. The family income variable only reports the incomes of household members related to the head, while HHINCOME includes the incomes of all household members. HHINCOME specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below by Census year (and data sample if specified).

User Note: Amounts are expressed in contemporary dollars, and users studying change over time must adjust for inflation (See Description).

      <txt><![CDATA[PERWT indicates how many persons in the U.S. population are represented by a given person in an IPUMS sample. 

It is generally a good idea to use PERWT when conducting a person-level analysis of any IPUMS sample. The use of PERWT is optional when analyzing one of the "flat" or unweighted IPUMS samples. Flat IPUMS samples include the 1% samples from 1850-1930, all samples from 1960, 1970, and 1980, the 1% unweighted samples from 1990 and 2000, the 10% 2010 sample, and any of the full count 100% census datasets. PERWT must be used to obtain nationally representative statistics for person-level analyses of any sample other than those.

For further explanation of the sample weights, see "Sample Designs" [URL omitted from DDI.] and "Sample Weights" [URL omitted from DDI.]. See also HHWT for a corresponding variable at the household level, and SLWT for a weight variable used with sample-line records in 1940 and 1950.]]></txt>
      <codInstr><![CDATA[
PERWT is a 6-digit numeric variable which indicates how many persons in the U.S. population are represented by a given person in an IPUMS sample and has two implied decimals. For example, a PERWT value of 010461 should be interpreted as 104.61. PERWT specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below if applicable by Census year (and data sample if specified).

      <labl>Relationship to household head [general version]</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[RELATE describes an individual's relationship to the head of household or householder. Beginning in 1880, data on household relationship was asked of every person. The general relationship code is reasonably comparable across years. The detailed code makes distinctions that cannot be made in all years.

The relationship codes are divided into two categories: relatives (codes 1-10) and non-relatives (codes 11-13). In general, the codes for relatives are self-explanatory. The non-relative codes are divided into three groups: "Partner, Friend, Visitor," roughly described as persons who do not pay or work for their accommodations (unless they share ownership); "Other Non-Relatives," including those persons paying or working for accommodations; and "Institutional Inmates." See the comparability discussion for further information about the coding scheme.

RELATE is not available for 1850-1870, but the IPUMS variable IMPREL produces similar results.  As a convenience, the extract system is set up so that users may include RELATE in extracts of the 1850-1870 samples.  In those years, RELATE contains the information that is documented in the IMPREL variable description.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[With the exception of the 1970-1990 Puerto Rican censuses, RACE was asked of every person in all years. The concept of race has changed over the more than 150 years represented in the IPUMS. Currently, the Census Bureau and others consider race to be a sociopolitical construct, not a scientific or anthropological one. Many detailed RACE categories consist of national origin groups. Beginning in 2000, the race question changed substantially to allow respondents to report as many races as they felt necessary to describe themselves. In earlier years, only one race response was coded.

IPUMS offers several variables describing the answer(s) to the race question. RACE provides the full detail given by the respondent and/or released by the Census Bureau; it is not always historically compatible (see comparability discussion below). Users primarily interested in historical compatibility should consider using RACESING, and should consult the race code relationship page, Relationship between RACE and RACESING codes [URL omitted from DDI.], for detail about how the RACE and RACESING codes are related.

In addition, specific combinations of major races can be discerned using the following bivariate indicators of whether a particular race group was reported: RACAMIND, RACASIAN, RACBLK, RACOTHER, RACPACIS, and RACWHT. RACNUM indicates the total number of major race groups reported for an individual. The information contained in the bivariate indicators and in RACNUM is integrated into the detailed version of RACE. Users primarily interested in historical comparability should consider using RACESING and/or the accompanying variables PROBAI, PROBAPI, PROBBLK, PROBOTH, and PROBWHT.  Note that Hispanic origin is assessed through separate questioning (see HISPAN).

Prior to 1960, the census enumerator was responsible for categorizing persons and was not specifically instructed to ask the individual his or her race. In 1970 and later years, an individual's race was reported by someone in the household or group quarters. In the 1990 U.S. census, the 2000 U.S. and Puerto Rican censuses, the ACS, and the PRCS respondents were specifically asked what race the person "considers himself/herself" to be, although such self-description was more or less operative since 1960.

User Note: Race questions were not asked in the Puerto Rican censuses of 1970, 1980, and 1990.  They were asked in the 1910 and 1920 Puerto Rican censuses, the 2000-2010 Puerto Rican censuses, and the PRCS.]]></txt>

Origin is defined by the Census Bureau as ancestry, lineage, heritage, nationality group, or country of birth.
